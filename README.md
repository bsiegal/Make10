How to play
--------------------------------------
* Try to 'Make 10' as many times as you can before the wall of tiles reaches the top.
* Move your tile piece by clicking/touching the tile above where you want to put it.  You may also move your tile piece by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.  Left arrow to move left, Right arrow to move right, Down arrow to drop your piece on to the tile wall.
* If your tile and the tile below it adds to 10, both will disappear and you will earn 10 points.  If any tiles touching the tile below your tile also adds to 10, they will also disappear and you will get bonus of 10 points for each.   
* You can change the level by trying to make 5 or 1 with fractions.
